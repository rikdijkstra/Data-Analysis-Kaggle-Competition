    "You have the medical records of $n$ number of patients in `flu_train.csv`. There are two general types of patients in the data, flu patients and healthy (this is recorded in the column labeled `flu`, a 0 indicates the absences of the virus and a 1 indicates presence). Notice that the dataset is unbalanced and you can expect a similar imbalance in the testing set.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your task:** build a model to predict if a given patient has the flu. Your goal is to catch as many flu patients as possible without misdiagnosing too many healthy patients.\n",

    "**The deliverable:** submit your final solution via Kaggle competition using the `flu_test.csv` data.\n",

    "Here are some benchmarks for comparison and for expectation management. Notice that because the dataset is unbalanced, we expect that there is going to be a large difference in the accuracy for each class, thus `accuracy` is a metric that might be misleading in this case (see also below). That's why the baselines below are based on the expected accuracy **per class** and also they give you an estimate for the AUROC on all patients in the testing data. This is the score you see in the Kaggle submission as well.\n",

    "However, it would be more complete to look at the data and allow the data to inform your decision on how to address missingness. For columns where NaN values are informative, you might want to treat NaN as a distinct value; You might want to drop predictors with too many missing values and impute the ones with few missing values using a model. There are many acceptable strategies here, as long as the appropriateness of the method in the context of the task and the data is discussed."
